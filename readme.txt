In this project, we will take language code & text to be translated from the user as input and translate it into other languages and also provide the translated text. We just write our python script in any text editor or IDE and run it. After running the script we can enter the code of the language from the provided options and get it translated.

Project Prerequisites:
You have to install only one package in your system to run this script. Because we muse google translator API here.

googletrans: Googletrans is a free and unlimited python library that implemented Google Translate API. This uses the Google Translate Ajax API to make calls to such methods as detecting and translating.

Compatible with Python 3.6+.
